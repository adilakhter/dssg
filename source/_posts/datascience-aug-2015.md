###Featurizing log data for predicting dropouts in MOOC @ KDDCup 2015

Xavier will present the solution he and his colleagues from DataRobot developed to win the 3rd prize at the KDDCup 2015. The competition consisted of predicting dropouts of students of XuetangX, a MOOC platform initiated by Tsinghua University in China. Xavier will describe how he converted students log data into usable features for Machine Learning using counts, simple statistics, entropy, factorization and text mining techniques.
