## Change the Game with Data and Analytics

McLaren Applied Technologies (M.A.T) is a global engineering and technology company set up to harness significant R&D, technical expertise and innovation spirit that have kept McLaren racing at the pinnacle of elite motorsport for five decades. M.A.T has now extended this knowledge and approach to lift the performance of and inspire innovation in blue-chip companies, like-minded pioneers and visionaries. In this talk, I will introduce M.A.Tâ€™s story and its fundamental technological approach that is underpinned by data and analytics, to help our partners lift the performances in various industrial verticals. I will also overview our current development in human performance/condition monitoring and predictive machine health with succinct case studies.
