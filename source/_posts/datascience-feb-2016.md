##Narrativeviz Consulting
Even though exploring data visually is an integral part of the data analytics pipeline, we struggle to visually explore data once the number of dimensions goes beyond three. This talk will focus on showcasing techniques to visually explore multidimensional data (p > 3). The aim is to show examples of each of the following techniques, potentially using one exemplar dataset.

The talk will also explore the role of interaction approaches to enhance our ability to visually explore the multidimensional data.
