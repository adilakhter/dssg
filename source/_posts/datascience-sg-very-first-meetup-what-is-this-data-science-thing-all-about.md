**Presentation by Eugene (The Zen of Data Science) **

Data Science, Big Data, Advanced Analytics, Machine Learning…The buzzwords are many, the opportunities are great, and the complexity can be overwhelming.This presentation focuses on the heart, or "Zen" of the issue, presenting key concepts, distinguishing core from detail and helping you to effectively navigate the complexity.This is a high-level, non-technical presentation sharing key insights on this strategic business function. A must for those developing their own analytics/data science capability.

[ [slides](http://datascience.sg/meetup/Introduction%20to%20Data%20Science_San.pdf) ] [ video ]

This is a very short introduction on Analytics/Data Science. It looks at Analytics from the business angle. Discussion will be on how Analytics came about and what kind of value business can get from Analytics. The discussion also takes on managing the expectations on Analytics, what can or cannot be expected from it.
