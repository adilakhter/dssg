For our June bonus meetup, we're excited to have Adam Drake, CEO / Chief Data Officer of Atazzo. 

### Big Data, Small Machine by Adam Drake. 

Sypnosis: Datasets too large to fit into RAM are increasingly common, even in simple environments like Kaggle competitions. Adam will introduce some ways of dealing with this issue in addition to demonstrating some scalable machine learning techniques which are production ready and capable of processing over 10s of thousands of events per second on an old laptop.
