Agenda

2pm: Welcome by Kai Xin (Co-founder, Data Science SG)

2.15pm: Talk by Wu Dan

Taking its first steps in the early days of Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, the Healthcare Analytics Unit at Alexandra Health System, Singapore, has been continuing to grow along with the healthcare group. This presentation will tell the story of how the Analytics Unit was conceived and has continued to grow in size, capabilities and scope as it applies data science to many areas, both within the hospital as well as for the community. This story will be illustrated through case studies, ranging from planning and resource optimization to improving service delivery, and the many lessons learned along the way.
2.45pm: Talk by Allen Day

Medicine is undergoing a renaissance that is made possible by analyzing and creating insights from this huge and growing number of genomes. Personalized medicine is simply the practical application of these insights.

In this session, I will show how ETL and MapReduce can be applied in a clinical setting. I will also show how NoSQL and advanced analytics can be used to "reverse engineer" the genetic causes of disease. Such information can be used to predict and prevent individual suffering, as well as to increase the overall health of a society.

3.30pm: Networking &amp; end of Event

-Please note that refreshments will NOT be provided.
