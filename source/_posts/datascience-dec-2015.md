##Profile of speakers: 

###Panelist

• Albert Bifet is a big data scientist with 10+ years of international experience in research and in leading new open source software projects for business analytics, data mining, and machine learning (Institut Mines-Télécom, Huawei, Yahoo, University of Waikato, UPC). He obtained a Ph.D. from UPC-BarcelonaTech. Albert has worked in Hong Kong, New Zealand, and Europe. At Yahoo Labs, he co-founded Apache SAMOA (Scalable Advanced Massive Online Analysis) in 2013. Apache SAMOAis a distributed streaming machine learning (ML) framework that contains a programing abstraction for distributed streaming ML algorithms. At the WEKA Machine Learning group, he has co-led MOA (Massive Online Analysis) since 2008. 

• Shirshanka Das is the architect for LinkedIn’s Data Analytics Infrastructure team. He was among the original authors of a variety of open and closed source projects built at LinkedIn, including Databus, Espresso, and Apache Helix. His current focus at LinkedIn includes all things Hadoop, high-performance distributed OLAP engines, large-scale data ingestion, transformation and movement, and data lineage and discovery. 

• Wes McKinney is a software engineer at Cloudera and lead developer of Ibis. He is the creator of Python’s pandas library and is the author of Python for Data Analysis. Previously, Wes was the founder and CEO of DataPad. 

•  Jennifer Marsman is a principal developer evangelist in Microsoft’s Developer and Platform Evangelism group, where she educates developers on Microsoft’s new technologies. In this role, Jennifer is a frequent speaker at software development conferences across the United States. In 2009, Jennifer was chosen as “Techie whose innovation will have the biggest impact” by X-OLOGY for her work with GiveCamps, a weekend-long event where developers code for charity. Prior to becoming a developer evangelist, Jennifer was a software developer in Microsoft’s Natural Interactive Services division. In this role, she earned two patents for her work in search and data mining algorithms.

##Tech Startup Lightning Talks:

Fangjin Yang is a co-author of the open source Druid project and a co-founder of Imply, a data analytics startup based in San Francisco. Previously, he held senior engineering positions at Metamarkets and Cisco Systems. Fangjin holds a BASc in Electrical Engineering and a MASc in Computer Engineering from the University of Waterloo, Canada.  

Arshak Navruzyan has served in product management and engineering leadership roles at Argyle Data, Alpine Data Labs, Endeca, and Oracle. He is a contributor to the Apache Accumulo project and the organizer of the San Francisco Machine Learning Meetup group. Arshak’s objective is to make machine learning accessible to any organization or individual that wants to transform the world through data. With this aim, he cofounded Startup.ML. 

Adam Gibson is founder of  Skymind.io, who provides deep learning as a service. Adam and his team are the proud creators of the world’s first open-source, distributed, commercial-grade deep-learning framework: Deeplearning4j.org. They also built ND4J, a scientific computing library for the JVM. Adam is also the co-author of "Deep Learning - A Practitioner's Approach" to be released on O'Reilly Media.
