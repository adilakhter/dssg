Ezzeri Esa, co-founder of Kaggle Berlin Meetup and speaker at PyCon UK is here in Singapore to give us a short workshop on python! He'll be assisted by Helen Khumthong

Abstract: Spending months on the nuances of machine learning models is a luxury most of us don’t have. This hands-on, practical IPython tutorial aims to provide a highly-directed introduction to machine learning through solving Kaggle problems. We’ll start with data manipulation using pandas - loading data, cleaning data and making simple plots. We then use scikit-learn to make predictions. By the end of the session, we would have solved a supervised learning problem from start to finish, as well as see how well we did on the leaderboard. Time-permitting, we will review a number of ways to improve our results - through feature engineering, cross-validation and model parameter selection.


You can download the Python packages and IPython notebooks ahead of time.
