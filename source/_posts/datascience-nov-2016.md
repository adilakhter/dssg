We have team Data Ninja & YNC Hacks, who represented Singapore as the finalist in the Data Science Games at Paris! 

The Data Science Game is a Data Science competition organized by the main “Grandes Écoles” of Paris. Teams of students from the best Data Science programs around the world are expected to compete over a “real-world” problem. A first qualifier phase of the competition took place online in June. The 20 best teams were invited for the final phase of the competition, which took place in Paris in September.  

The qualifier phase was a image classification challenge and 2 teams from Singapore, Data Ninja (NUS) and YNC Hacks (Yale-NUS) managed to clinch the 9th and 17th spot respectively, earning them the spot to represent Singapore in the final phase in Paris. https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/data-science-game-2016-online-selection/leaderboard. The final phase is an insurance quote conversion challenge. They managed to rank 5th and 6th in the final phase, just behind teams from Russia, UK, France and Italy. http://www.datasciencegame.com/leaderboard

They will share the approaches they employed in both phases as well as lessons learnt, using both as use cases contrasting deep learning and traditional machine learning techniques.

A typical day for Gin lasts around 30 hours, in which she solves wavelet transformations and permutation groups, lifts weights (yeah she lifts bro), dances to jazz and hip-hop, and takes down guys in touch rugby. Oh and she sleeps for three hours.
