<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">**David Ayman Shamma** leads the HCI Research group at Yahoo Labs and is currently a senior visiting research fellow at NUS. His personal research investigates synchronous environments and connected experiences both online and in-the-world. Focusing on creative expression and sharing frameworks, he designs and prototypes systems for multimedia-mediated communication, as well as, develops targeted methods and metrics for understanding how people communicate online in small environments and at web scale. Ayman is the creator and lead investigator on the Yahoo Zync project and he is the scientific liaison to Flickr.</span>

**Presentation topic : <strong>"Science and the Social Photograph"**</strong>

It has been suggested that over 10% of all the photos in the world were taken in the past 12 months; these photos are not only digitally captured, but many of them were instantly shared through Facebook, Flickr, Instagram, and the like — leaving a mass of data: visual, social, and meta. In this short talk, I'll present a few examples of how scientists at Yahoo Labs navigate this data to answer scientific questions about the new practice of social photography.

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">**David Hardoon** is the Associate Director, Information Management &amp; Business Analytics, ASEAN at Ernst &amp; Young; a subject matter expert and evangelist for business analytics. In this 'think-tank' role he bridges the gap between business development and analytical capabilities, seeking to convert analytical thinking into successful business strategies. David regularly conducts business analytics seminars and workshops, for audiences ranging from executive level to power users, providing in-depth understanding of 'what-is' business analytics and how it can be harnessed to improve current business processes as well as to solve various business-specific problems.</span>

**Presentation topic :** ** "An Industrial Roadmap to Analytics"**

In this sharing session we will focus on the perspective of how analytics can be successfully adopted by industry mass (not just Google, Facebook and Yahoo of the worlds). What are the key ingredients beyond the technical prunes of the avid data science warrior.
