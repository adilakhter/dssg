For this month's meetup, we are excited to have Rakuten hosting us at their office in 1, George Street. Researchers from RIT (Rakuten Institute of Technology), including head of RIT Global will speak on their research work. 

Agenda:

Event starts at 7.15 pm.

- Welcome by Ewa Szymanksa, heading RIT Singapore 
- RIT global overview by Masaya Mori, the founder of RIT 
- Case study by Youngjoo: Information retrieval – Finding food entity relationships using user-generated data in a Recipe Sharing Service 

Abstract: Rakuten recipe is a Japanese recipe site where users submit and share their recipes with other users. Since the contents are user-generated, the recipes often contain misspellings, abbreviations, synonyms, hypernyms, and hyponyms. Identifying and normalizing these words is essential to retrieving relevant recipes according to user's search request. In this talk, Youngjoo will introduce a new approach to finding related words in a recipe domain using the data structure.
