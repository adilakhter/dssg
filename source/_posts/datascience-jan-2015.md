###Common Misconceptions in Analytics 

When it comes to learning about Analytics, most people think of classroom training. The value of getting your hands dirty and especially learning from mistakes is often overlooked. The presentation that you see is often the result of many rounds of scrubbing. The speaker will share some of the common mistakes that he has observed and provide a glimpse of the working drafts before they were scrubbed and polished. He will also talk about the critical success factors that will make or break Analytics implementation.
