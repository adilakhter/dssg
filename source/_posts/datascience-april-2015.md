Title: Location-based Analytics for Marketing Research

Nielsen is a leading marketing research company, over 90 years old, employing some 35,000 staff, and present around the world. This talk will cover work by the Nielsen Innovation Lab in Singapore. First we look into how satellite imagery can be used to improve sampling through the use of machine learning techniques, and then how the same techniques were applied to automate work allocations for field interviews on a major project. In closing, weâ€™ll look at exploratory work in how location could be used to enhance the quality of outlet records and measure exposure to outdoor advertising.
