###Beeline.SG

Speaker Bio

Daniel Sim is a Data Scientist at the Infocomm Development Authority. He did his Bachelors in Computer Science at the University of Cambridge (2013) and Masters at ETH Zurich (2015). In 2014, he worked on one of the algorithms underlying Beeline as an intern and is currently assisting helping Beeline get past the fledgling state. He is a strong believer in D-R-Y and believes in aggressively automating away any repetitive tasks.

Synopsis

Beeline seeks to create a bridge between the cheap but lengthier public transport and faster but costly private transport. To achieve this, we bring together crowd-sourced insights and historical data analytics

In this session, we will cover the following:

- How crowdsourcing is combined with historical data to optimise bus route

- What operational issues arise when transitioning analytics-proposed routes into real-world deployment

- Whether our experimentation succeeded, or failed, in changing the commuting patterns of Singapore

- How we process large amount of farecard transaction and taxi data (using a graph-based algorithm)

###Data.Gov.SG

Speaker Bio

Lin Zhaowei is a consultant in IDA's Data Science Division, focusing on data-driven narratives and open data standards. He is part of a five-member team currently working on the new data.gov.sg portal. Before joining IDA, he was Interactive Graphics Editor at The Straits Times, in charge of conceptualising, designing and creating interactives and data visualisations for the newspaper's digital products.

Synopsis

Data.gov.sg was launched in 2011 as the Singapore government's one-stop portal to its open data. The new data.gov.sg, now in public beta, goes beyond being a data repository. It aims to make government data relevant and understandable to the public, through the active use of charts and articles.We will discuss the key features on the new data.gov.sg, such as real-time APIs, dashboards and data blog. We will also share on our data quality guide, which will assist government agencies in converting their data from human-readable report formats into reusable, machine-readable formats.

###Book Prize Winner

We also held a raffle book prize and congratulation our winners for the Hadoop Application Architectures Book! Prizes are sponsored by Oreilly, see you at the Strata Community Meetup on 3rd Dec!
