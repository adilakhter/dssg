In this meetup, we will have a brief introduction to Julia, and why it is fast. We will focus on the developments in Julia’s parallel computing capabilities. The Julia Lab at MIT is developing a number of tools - representing parallel computations as DAGs, scheduling them efficiently on a distributed cluster, and having the right abstractions for solving a large class of modern linear algebra problems, that include recommendation engines, distributed out of core logistic regressions and deep neural nets. Our focus is on scalability and performance without giving up on readability.

##Speaker Bio

###Dr. Viral Shah
Co-inventor of Julia and co-founder of Julia Computing. Along with Alan Edelman, Stefan Karpinski and Jeff Bezanson, he create Julia - a high-level, high-performance, dynamic, open-source language for numerical computing. Julia is estimated to be in use by 150,000 users worldwide, and has close to a 1000 community contributed packages. He is also the co-author of a bestselling book: Rebooting India, and worked on re-architecting social security payments in the Government of India at India’s largest biometric ID project, Aadhaar. He has a PhD in computer science from UC Santa Barbara.

###Prof Alan Edelman
Professor of Applied Mathematics, and in 2004 founded Interactive Supercomputing (recently acquired by Microsoft). He received the B.S. & M.S. degrees in mathematics from Yale in 1984, and the Ph.D. in applied mathematics from MIT in 1989 under the direction of Lloyd N. Trefethen. He joined the MIT faculty in applied mathematics in 1993. Edelman's research interests include high performance computing, numerical computation, linear algebra and stochastic eigenanalysis (random matrix theory). He has consulted for Akamai, IBM, Pixar, and NKK Japan among other corporations.
