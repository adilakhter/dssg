An evening of HR Analytics with head of talent acquisition APAC, GroupM Michael Wright! Also, it is finally on a weekday evening! For all those on weekend curfews do join us!

7.15pm: Networking (BYOR - Bring Your Own Refreshments =)

7.30pm: Michael Wright: No more gut feel hiring. How GroupM used data to speed up hiring, ensure compliance and make better hiring decisions.

We’ve deployed a reference checking system which works with data to score candidates on job-specific competencies. This system has enabled us to conduct more than 1800 reference checks in just 7 months across more than 11 markets. It’s saved us more than 800 hours, prevented numerous bad hires and helped us to identify star talent who were not from our industry.

8.15pm: Closing and networking

Michael Wright

I am a possibility-broker for people with superior talent.

I am part story-teller, salesman, coach and team builder.

I try to deliver value with every interaction.

I aim to connect the most talented people in the world with the most exciting communications services business in the world. To create value with every interaction. I'm pushing the recruiting envelope with Social, Mobile and Video. I'm getting talent to think differently about how they package themselves up for better gigs. I'm abolishing the resume format [or at least, trying].

The most fun I'm having at the moment is evolving the selection processes for the digital age - using automation, video, data &amp; analytics, and providing platforms to our business to democratize and power-up the business of recruiting by getting everyone involved in doing it.
