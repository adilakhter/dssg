###A*STAR: Alex Chia

With the rapid growth in the usage of social networks worldwide, uploading and sharing of user-generated content has become increasingly prevalent. In particular, users are increasingly sharing visual content, often accompanied with limited amount of text. We believe, as social media moves in a more visual direction, monitoring & advertising technologies needs to be more visual. In this talk, we present our technologies which leverage on this new source of data to monitor and track events as well as to profile social media users.
