Talk by Ben Sadeghi

Julia is a new language intended for scientific computing. With its C-like speed, familiar Matlab/Numpy style API, extensive standard library, metaprogramming and parallel processing capabilities, it is rapidly gaining ground within the data science community.

In this talk we'll go through brief introductions to the language and some of the packages available for data wrangling, visualization, analysis and prediction.

Wired article on Julia: [http://www.wired.com/2014/02/julia](http://www.wired.com/2014/02/julia)

Excerpt: “People have assumed that we need both fast and slow languages,” Bezanson says. “I happen to believe that we don’t need slow languages.”
