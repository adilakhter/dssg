For our meetup in February, Quy and Yi Xiang will be sharing about their experience in data science competitions on DrivenData and Kaggle respectively.

Quy competed in the DrivenData Safe Aging Challenge, where competitors were charged with building computer algorithms that could translate the easier-to-collect sensor data into harder-to-collect information about real activities (https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/42/).

Yi Xiang competed in the Kaggle Allstate Claims Severity Challenge, where competitors were challenged to create an algorithm which accurately predicts claims severity (https://www.kaggle.com/c/allstate-claims-severity).
