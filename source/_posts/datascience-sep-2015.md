###Drones at Work

Garuda Robotics builds drone systems and use them to capture data and generate actionable insights. For this meetup, they will share about using drone captured photos for computer vision.

Synopsis: What exactly goes on in the commercial drone/UAV industry in Singapore and globally? Behind the hype of consumer “selfie” drones lies a vast number of interesting commercial applications, where drones become an enabler for enterprises to gain new aerial perspectives of their facilities and estates, to make intelligent decisions incorporating this additional dimension of data.
In this presentation, we will look at one such drones-at-work application to reveal some of the behind-the-scene processes and technologies employed. Specifically, we will dive into the precision agriculture domain and share some of the computer vision problems we face, and take a look at various potential solutions to these challenges
