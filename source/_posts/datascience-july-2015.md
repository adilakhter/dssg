We'll be switching it up for this month's meetup with a more casual panel discussion. Three Data Science Leads/Data Scientists from Grabtaxi, Lazada, and Rakuten will be sharing on "What makes a Data Scientist?" with Koo moderating.

Our meetup will be held at 1925, a brewery along Jalan Besar (~1km from  Farrer Park or Lavender MRT). They have kindly offered to host, and extend the happy hour promotion to, us from 7-8pm. We will end the panel promptly at 7.45pm and carry on chatting over craft beers =). Given that spaces are limited, please only RSVP if you're able to arrive punctually (you can drop by after 7.45 without RSVP-ing). Thank you!
