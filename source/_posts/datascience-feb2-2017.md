In Twitter data, you have access to the world’s largest public archive of human thought. That’s over 10 years of Tweets back to 2006. It’s also hundreds of millions of new Tweets rolling in every single day. So, as a marketer or data scientist, what would you do with access to the world's largest archive of human thought that has ever existed?

#TwitterDATA Meetup will bring together data scientists, analytics experts, marketing and IT leaders for an evening of inspiration on the power of social data. The event will be hosted at Twitter Singapore, where you will hear from Twitter Data’s Head of Data Science, Dr. Scott Hendrickson (@drskippy), who leads a team of data scientists and strategists working with some of the biggest companies in the world and Ben Truscello (@bentruscello), Head of Global Brands & Agencies for Twitter Data.

The session will also include a panel discussion with local data science experts, practitioners, and leaders who will share their experiences in working in the field of data science.
