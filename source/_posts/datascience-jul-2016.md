### Deep Learning Workshop By Martin Andrews

For our July meetup, we're excited to have Martin Andrews share about deep learning! Deep Learning is a hot topic, but has a steep initial learning curve. There will be code. Lots of code. To ease the pain, a pre-configured virtual machine will be handed out, so that participants can run it on their own laptops using cross-platform open-source VirtualBox. Bring a laptop with VirtualBox installed!
